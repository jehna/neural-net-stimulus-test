# Neural net stimulus test

Testing how recurring stimulus can flow in a randomly connected neural net.

Result: Sometimes it flows quite interestingly.

You can run the `index.html` in your browser. If the neural net starts to
perform a "heartbeat", you can turn off the stimulus (`Toggle Ã¤rsytys` button)
and it should keep going. Whatever that means.

This is just a quick demo of one of my ideas about General Artificial
Intelligence. Nothing much.
